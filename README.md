# YAN (Yankovich Andrei Nikolaevich) - Developer
Hi everyone, I am game-dev Developer, but not only. I really like works with low/high level codes... like a 
* bitcoin forks 
* encryption algorithms 
* 3D and 2D game engines
* cross-platform apps (iOS/android/Linux/macOS/windows).

So if you want to implement your super ideas, write me. I think I can help you implement your cool ideas.

At this time, I am a main maintainer of the [QuasarApp](https://github.com/QuasarApp) group. So we already create useful projects like a [CQtDeployer](https://github.com/QuasarApp/CQtDeployer) or [CheatCard](https://www.cheatcard.net/) - and its not all ðŸ˜‰.

But QuasrarApp group it is not all. I really like works on games, games of [Playrix](https://github.com/Playrix). It is very good experience for me, and I hope that my work really useful for them)
