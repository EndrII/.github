# YAN (Yankovich Andrei Nikolaevich) - Developer, not bad developer...
Hi everyone, I am game-dev Developer, but not only. I really like works with low/high level codes... like a 
* bitcoin forks 
* encryption algorithms 
* 3D and 2D game engines
* cross-platform apps (iOS/android/Linux/macOS/windows).

So if you want to implement your super ideas, write me. I think i can help you with implementation of them.

At this time, I am a main maintainer of the [QuasarApp](https://github.com/QuasarApp) group. So we already created useful projects like a [CQtDeployer](https://github.com/QuasarApp/CQtDeployer) or [CheatCard](https://github.com/QuasarApp/CheatCard) - and this is not the whole list of our applications ðŸ˜‰.
