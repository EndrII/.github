# YAN (Yankovich Andrei Nikolaevich) - Developer
Hi everyone, I am game-dev Developer, but not only. I really like works with low/high level codes... like a bitcoin forks, encryption algorithms, 3D and 2D game engines, cross-platform apps (iOS/android/Linux/macOS/windows). So if you want to implement your super ideas, write me. I think I can help you implement your cool ideas.

At this time, I am a main maintainer of the QuasarApp group. So we already create useful projects like a CQtDeployer or CheatCard.

But QuasrarApp group it is not all. I really like works on games, games of Playtex. It is very good experience for me, and I hope that my work really useful for them)
